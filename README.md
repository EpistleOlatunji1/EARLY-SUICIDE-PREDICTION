# EARLY-SUICIDE-PREDICTION
 a machine learning–based framework for early suicide risk prediction using structured behavioral, demographic, and psychological indicators. The objective is to identify high-risk patterns at an early stage to support timely intervention, policy insights, and preventive decision-making.

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for high-dimensional risk indicators

Supervised learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Emphasis on recall and sensitivity to reduce false negatives in high-risk classification

Bias and ethical considerations in predictive health analytics

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

SQL for data extraction and transformation

Data visualization for exploratory analysis and model interpretation

📊 Key Outcomes

Identification of statistically significant predictors associated with elevated suicide risk

Performance comparison across multiple machine learning models

Demonstration of how data-driven approaches can enhance early warning systems in public health contexts

⚠️ Ethical Considerations

This project is strictly analytical and preventive in nature.
It is not intended for diagnosis or clinical decision-making and emphasizes responsible AI use, data privacy, and harm-minimization principles.

🌍 Potential Applications

Public health surveillance and prevention programs

Mental health research and policy analysis

Early-warning decision support systems (non-clinical)
